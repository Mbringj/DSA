# Data Structures and Algorithms

This project contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript and Python. The project is organized into chapters, each focusing on a specific topic.

## Project Structure

- **chap0_introduction/**: Basic algorithms and introductory examples.

- **chap1_recursion_backtracking/**: Examples of recursion and backtracking.

- **chap3_linked_list/**: Implementations of linked lists.

- **chap4_stacks/**: Implementations of stacks.

- **chap5_Qeues/**: Implementations of queues.

- **chap6_Trees/**: Implementations of trees.

- **chap10_sorting/**: Sorting algorithms.

## Getting Started

To run the JavaScript files, you can use Node.js. For example:
```sh
node chap0_introduction/IsPrimerNumber.js
